# CryptoTrading
 
This was done as a takehome assignement for aquariux
This springboot applications uses minimal external libraries and 
will be able to be boot up by  running the class "TradingApplication" through an IDE or
mvn spring-boot:run through the CMD


I personally feel this is not my best job and I could done alot more one factor is that I lack knowledge about crypto trading, and another is that due to time constraint due to my dayjob and being on call support.
The team if reviewing the code can most probably spot plenty of incomplete code, design issues and functionality issues
and lack of unit tests

Attached is the collection for simple testing.
