# CryptoTrading
 
This was done as a takehome assignement for aquariux
This springboot applications uses minimal external libraries and 
will be able to be boot up by  running the class "TradingApplication" through an IDE or
mvn spring-boot:run through the CMD


I personally feel this is not my best job and I could done alot more, but due to time constraint and being on call in my day job, I am unable to do so,
the team if reviewing the code can most probably spot plenty of incomplete code, design issues and functionality issues
and lack of unit tests
